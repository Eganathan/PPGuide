<li><strong>Be specific</strong> - &ldquo;Aphids on lower leaves of row 3&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;pest problem&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Record immediately</strong> - Note observations the same day they occur</li>
<li><strong>Use consistent terms</strong> - Makes searching easier later</li>
<li><strong>Include context</strong> - Weather, recent activities, or anything relevant</li>
<li><strong>Review periodically</strong> - Past notes often contain valuable lessons</li>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is Notes different from Tasks?</strong></summary>
<p>Notes record observations and information (what happened, what you saw). Tasks schedule future activities (what needs to be done). Use Notes to document, use Tasks to plan.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add photos to notes?</strong></summary>
<p>For photos, use the Documents action which is designed for file attachments. Notes are text-based. You can create a note and a document together to combine text observations with photos.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>How do I find old notes?</strong></summary>
<p>Navigate to the module (crop, livestock, etc.) and open the Notes section. You can scroll through the history or search for keywords.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Should I create separate notes or one long note?</strong></summary>
<p>Create separate notes for different topics or dates. This makes it easier to find specific information later. Each note is date-stamped, so multiple notes per day is fine.</p>
