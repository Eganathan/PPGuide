Manage crop stages, monitor growth progress, and record all related activities throughout each season.\nKey Features# Crop Types# Specify the crop type to automatically classify as annual or perennial. This determines how the crop lifecycle and field associations are managed.\nStage Tracking# Track your crop through 7 stages: Preparation, Seeding, Growing, Fruiting, Harvesting, Post-Harvest, and Sold.\nSeason Management# Create seasons to organize activities by crop cycle. For perennial crops, new seasons are prompted automatically when the crop is marked as sold.\nField Association# Link crops to specific fields to track which areas are in use. Fields are automatically released based on crop type and stage.\nCrop Stages# Stage Description Preparation Initial stage for preparing the field and planning the crop cycle Seeding Seeds or seedlings have been planted in the field Growing Crop is actively growing and developing Fruiting Crop has begun producing fruits, grains, or harvestable produce Harvesting Crop is ready for or currently being harvested Post-Harvest Harvest complete. Processing, drying, or storage activities Sold Crop has been sold. Field release behavior depends on crop type Annual vs Perennial Crops# Annual Crops# Annual crops complete their lifecycle in one season. When marked as Sold, associated fields are automatically released for new crops.\nPerennial Crops# Perennial crops continue across multiple seasons. When marked as Sold, the crop automatically moves to Preparation stage for a new season. Fields remain associated until the crop is moved to Removed stage.\nTip: To release fields from a perennial crop, update the crop status to \u0026ldquo;Removed\u0026rdquo;.\nSupported Actions# Action Usage Income Record sales revenue from your harvest. Track buyer details, quantities sold, and sale prices. Expenses Track all costs including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, labor, equipment rental, and other inputs. Tasks Schedule and manage farming activities like irrigation, spraying, weeding, and harvesting. Notes Record observations about crop health, weather conditions, pest sightings, or any important information. Yields Record harvest quantities and quality metrics to track productivity across seasons. Documents Attach photos, receipts, certificates, or any relevant documents to your crop records. Tips# Create a new season for each crop cycle to maintain organized records and compare performance across seasons. Update crop stages regularly to get accurate insights into your farming activities. Use the Notes action to document weather events, pest observations, or farming experiments. Record expenses immediately after purchase to maintain accurate cost tracking. Take photos of crop growth at each stage using Documents for visual progress tracking. For perennial crops, remember to create a new season after marking as Sold to continue tracking. Frequently Asked Questions# How do I release fields from a perennial crop? For perennial crops, fields remain associated across seasons. To release the fields, update the crop status to \u0026ldquo;Removed\u0026rdquo;. This will free the fields for use with other crops.\nWhen should I create a new season? For annual crops, create a new crop entry for each planting. For perennial crops, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to create a new season when you mark the crop as Sold. You can also manually create a new season anytime.\nWhat happens when I mark a crop as Sold? For annual crops, the associated fields are automatically released. For perennial crops, the system prompts you to create a new season and moves the crop back to Preparation stage.\nCan I track multiple varieties of the same crop? Yes, create separate crop entries for each variety. This allows you to track performance, costs, and yields independently for each variety.\nHow do I track crop profitability? Record all expenses and income for your crop. The app calculates profit by comparing total income against total expenses for each crop and season.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/en/docs/","title":"Documentation","section":"Personal Pannai Guide","content":"Personal Pannai Documentation# Welcome to the complete documentation for Personal Pannai.

Frequently Asked Questions# How are fields linked to crops? When creating a new crop, you can select one or more fields to associate with it. The fields will show as \u0026ldquo;in use\u0026rdquo; until the crop cycle completes.\nCan I see what crops were grown on a field before? Yes, each field maintains a crop history showing all crops that have been grown on it. This helps you plan crop rotation and track field productivity over time.\nCan one field have multiple crops at the same time? A field can only be associated with one active crop at a time. Once the crop is marked as Sold (for annual) or Removed (for perennial), the field becomes available for new crops.\nWhat's the difference between field expenses and crop expenses? Field expenses are costs related to the field itself (land preparation, fencing, permanent irrigation) that aren\u0026rsquo;t specific to any crop. Crop expenses are directly related to growing a particular crop (seeds, fertilizers for that crop).\nHow does crop history help with rotation? The crop history shows you what was planted on each field and when. This data helps you avoid planting the same crop family consecutively, maintain soil health, and break pest cycles.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/en/docs/modules/","title":"Modules","section":"Documentation","content":"Farm Modules# Personal Pannai organizes your farm data into modules.

Enable individual tracking only for dairy cattle where you need per-animal yield records. For poultry and large herds, use group tracking to save time on record keeping. Record milk yields daily to identify production trends and top-performing animals. Use tasks to set vaccination and health checkup reminders. Link income to buyer contacts to track which buyers purchase your livestock products. Track feed expenses from inventory to calculate cost per animal or per liter of milk. Document parentage for breeding stock to maintain lineage records. Frequently Asked Questions# When should I use individual tracking? Use individual tracking for dairy cattle when you want to monitor each animal\u0026rsquo;s milk production separately. This helps identify high and low producers. For meat animals, poultry, or large herds, group tracking is more practical.\nWhy can't I see the Animals action? The Animals action is only available when: 1) Animal type is Cattle, 2) Raised For is Dairy, and 3) Track Individually is turned ON. Check these settings in your livestock entry.\nCan I track individual animals for poultry? Individual tracking is currently available only for dairy cattle. Poultry is typically managed as a flock/group due to the large numbers involved.\nHow do I record milk yield per animal? First, enable individual tracking for your dairy cattle. Then add each animal using the Animals action. When recording yields, you can select the specific animal to attribute the milk production to.\nCan I change from group tracking to individual tracking later? Yes, you can enable individual tracking for existing dairy cattle entries. After enabling, you can start adding individual animal records.\nWhat are the breeding cycle options? You can track female animals as: Open (not bred, ready for breeding), Bred (mated but not confirmed pregnant), or Pregnant (confirmed pregnancy). Update this as the animal progresses through the cycle.\nWhat is milking status? Milking status indicates whether a dairy animal is currently producing milk. Options are: Milking (actively producing) or Dry (not producing, typically during late pregnancy or rest period).\nWhat is lactation number? Lactation number tracks how many times the animal has calved and started a new milk production cycle. First-time mothers are in their 1st lactation, and this increases with each subsequent calving.\nHow do I record when an animal is sold or dies? Open the animal\u0026rsquo;s profile and update the status to \u0026ldquo;Sold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Deceased\u0026rdquo;. This keeps the animal\u0026rsquo;s historical records while removing it from active herd counts.\nWhat is the difference between Sire and Dam? Sire refers to the father of the animal, and Dam refers to the mother. Recording both helps you track lineage, identify genetic traits, and make better breeding decisions.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/en/docs/actions/tasks/","title":"Tasks","section":"Actions","content":"Tasks Action# Schedule and manage farming activities and reminders.\nPurpose# Plan and track activities like irrigation, spraying, harvesting, vaccinations, and maintenance.\nKey Features# Create tasks with due dates Set task priorities Mark tasks as complete Get reminders for upcoming activities Available In# Crops Fields Livestock Machines Farms Tips# Create tasks for recurring activities like weekly spraying or monthly maintenance Set priorities to focus on urgent farming activities Review pending tasks daily to stay on top of farm work Best Practices# Plan tasks at the beginning of each week Set realistic due dates based on weather and resources Update task status promptly to track actual vs planned work "},{"id":10,"href":"/en/docs/faq/","title":"FAQ","section":"Documentation","content":"Frequently Asked Questions# Find answers to common questions about Personal Pannai, organized by topic.\nQuick Links# Crops FAQ Fields FAQ Livestock FAQ Machines FAQ Inventory FAQ Contacts FAQ Roles FAQ General Questions# What is Personal Pannai?

Disable unused inventory items instead of leaving them active to keep your list clean. Record batch numbers and expiry dates in Notes for products that expire. Link fuel inventory to machine expenses to track fuel consumption per tractor. Use Feed and Health categories to track livestock input costs separately. Choose the appropriate unit (Kg, Liters, or Unit) based on how you purchase and use the item. Frequently Asked Questions# How do I add new stock to inventory? Open the inventory item and use the Add transaction to record new stock. Enter the quantity and optionally link it to an expense record for cost tracking.\nHow do I record inventory usage? You can either use the Use transaction directly on the inventory item, or select the inventory item when recording an expense on a Crop, Field, or other module. The second method automatically updates inventory stock.\nWhat's the difference between consumables and producibles? Consumables are items you purchase and use (seeds, fertilizers, fuel). Producibles are items you create on the farm (harvested yields). The transaction labels differ: consumables are Added/Used, producibles are Produced/Sold.\nWhy can't I delete an inventory item? Inventory items cannot be deleted to preserve transaction history and maintain accurate records. Instead, disable items you no longer use. You can re-activate them later if needed.\nHow do I track inventory costs per crop? When recording expenses on a crop, select the inventory items used. This links the consumption to that crop, allowing you to see total input costs per crop.\nWhat is a reversal transaction? Reversal is used to correct mistakes in previous Add or Use transactions. It adjusts the stock balance without deleting the original transaction, maintaining a complete audit trail.\nHow do I see current stock levels? The inventory list shows current stock for each item. Open an item to see the History tab with detailed transactions and closing balances.\nHow does cost per unit work? You can set and update the cost per unit anytime. When you add new stock, the total cost increases by: new cost per unit × quantity added. Previous total cost is preserved, so your total reflects actual spending over time.\nWhat happens when I update the cost per unit? Updating cost per unit only affects future additions. For example, if your total was ₹100 (10 units at ₹10 each) and you change cost per unit to ₹20, then add 1 unit, your new total becomes ₹120 (₹100 + ₹20×1).\nHow do I track which vendor I bought from? When adding stock, use the \u0026ldquo;Bought From\u0026rdquo; field to select a contact from your phone. This helps you track purchase sources and compare prices from different vendors.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/en/docs/actions/yields/","title":"Yields","section":"Actions","content":"Yields Action# Track harvest quantities and production output.\nPurpose# Record crop harvests, milk production, egg collection, and other measurable outputs.\nKey Features# Record quantities harvested Track quality grades Monitor production trends Compare yields across seasons Available In# Crops Livestock Tips# Record yields on harvest day for accuracy Include quality information to track premium vs regular produce Compare yields across seasons to identify improvements Best Practices# Use consistent units of measurement Record both quantity and quality metrics Note any factors that affected the yield (weather, inputs, timing) "},{"id":15,"href":"/en/docs/modules/contacts/","title":"Contacts","section":"Modules","content":"Contacts Module# Manage your farm contacts including vendors, buyers, laborers, and other business relationships.

They must remove their existing farm before accepting an invite to another farm.\nAccount Deletion \u0026amp; Data Transfer# When any user deletes their account, all their data is automatically transferred to the farm owner.\nProcess# User initiates account deletion All data created by that user is migrated to the owner\u0026rsquo;s account Transferred data is marked/indicated as \u0026ldquo;transferred data\u0026rdquo; Farm records remain complete and intact Benefits# No data loss when team members leave Complete historical records maintained Continuity of farm documentation Transferred data clearly identified Tips# Assign the Manager role to trusted family members or senior staff who need full farm visibility. Use the Worker role for laborers and temporary staff who only need to see their assigned tasks. Workers can record their own expenses and activities without seeing sensitive financial data. Review user roles periodically and upgrade workers to managers as they take on more responsibility. Only share Owner access with someone you fully trust, as they would have farm deletion rights. Frequently Asked Questions# What's the difference between Owner and Manager? Owner and Manager have almost identical access to all farm data including income, expenses, analytics, and reports. The key differences are: only the Owner can delete the farm, and only the Owner can change other users\u0026rsquo; roles to/from Owner level.\nWhat can Workers see? Workers have a simplified view showing only: tasks assigned to them, expenses they created, documents they added, and notes they recorded. They cannot see income details, analytics, reports, or any data created by other users.\nWhy can't Workers see income? Income data contains sensitive financial information about the farm\u0026rsquo;s earnings. This is restricted to Owner and Manager roles to maintain financial privacy while allowing workers to perform their daily tasks.\nCan a Manager upgrade a Worker? Yes, Managers can upgrade Workers to Manager role. However, Managers cannot change the Owner\u0026rsquo;s role or downgrade other Managers - only the Owner has those permissions.\nWhat happens when someone deletes their account? All data created by that user (expenses, tasks, notes, etc.) is automatically transferred to the farm Owner\u0026rsquo;s account. This data is marked as \u0026ldquo;transferred data\u0026rdquo; so you know its origin, ensuring no farm records are lost.\nCan I have multiple Owners? Each farm has one Owner. If you need to give someone full access, make them a Manager - they\u0026rsquo;ll have access to all data and most management functions except farm deletion and owner-level role changes.\nHow do I invite someone to my farm? Go to Farmers → Invites → Create Invite, then send the invite to the person. When they create an account or open the app, they\u0026rsquo;ll see your invite and can accept it to join your farm.\nThe person I invited can't see the invite. What should they do? If they already have their own farm as an owner, they need to delete their farm first, then restart the app. The invite will then appear. A user can only be part of one farm at a time.\nCan someone be part of multiple farms? No, a user can only be part of one farm at a time. To join a different farm, they must first leave or delete their current farm.\n"}]
