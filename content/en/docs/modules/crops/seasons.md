# Seasons

Seasons help you organize crop activities by growth cycle. Each season represents one complete crop cycle from preparation to sale, allowing you to track performance and compare results across different periods.

## Why Use Seasons?

- **Organize activities** - Group expenses, income, yields, and tasks by crop cycle
- **Compare performance** - Analyze profitability across different seasons
- **Track history** - Maintain complete records for each growing period
- **Better reporting** - Generate season-specific reports

## Season Behavior by Crop Type

### Annual Crops
Annual crops complete their lifecycle in one season. Each new planting should be created as a new crop entry.

### Perennial Crops
Perennial crops continue across multiple seasons. When marked as **Sold**, the app automatically:
1. Prompts you to create a new season
2. Moves the crop back to **Preparation** stage
3. Keeps fields associated with the crop

> **Tip:** You can also manually create a new season anytime without marking the crop as Sold.

## Creating a Season

Seasons are created:
- **Automatically** - When a perennial crop is marked as Sold
- **Manually** - Anytime from the crop detail screen

When creating a season, give it a meaningful name like "2024 Summer" or "Season 1" to easily identify it later.

## Editing Season Names

Season names can be edited anytime. To rename a season:
1. Open the crop detail screen
2. Tap the season info component at the top
3. Select the season you want to rename
4. Edit the season name

Use clear, descriptive names to make it easy to identify seasons in reports and comparisons.

## Season Navigation

On the crop detail screen, tap the **season info component** at the top to open the season selector sheet.

### How Selection Affects Data

The selected season determines:
- **Data displayed** - Summary, actions, and reports show only that season's data
- **New actions** - Any new expenses, income, yields, tasks, or notes are recorded under the selected season

> **Example:** If you select "2024 Summer" season, all expenses you record will be attributed to that season. Switch to "All Seasons" to see the complete picture.
