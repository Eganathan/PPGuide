# Fields Module

Manage your agricultural fields and track their usage history. Associate fields with crops, maintain crop rotation records, and store field-specific activities.

## Key Features

### Field Registration
Register all your fields with details like area, location, and soil type.

### Crop Association
Associate fields with any new crop. Fields can be linked to track which areas are being cultivated for each crop.

### Crop History
View the complete history of crops grown on each field. This helps ensure proper crop rotation and plan future plantings.

### Field-Specific Records
Store expenses, tasks, notes, and documents specific to each field, separate from crop activities.

## Crop Rotation

Crop rotation is essential for soil health and pest management. The crop history feature helps you track what was grown on each field and when.

### Benefits
- View complete planting history for each field
- Plan crop rotation based on past records
- Identify patterns in field productivity
- Make informed decisions about future plantings

## Tips

- Add accurate field measurements to get precise per-acre cost and yield calculations.
- Review crop history before planting to ensure proper crop rotation.
- Use notes to track soil health observations and changes over time.
- Keep land documents attached to each field for easy reference.
- Record field-specific expenses separately from crop expenses for accurate cost tracking.
- Document drainage patterns and problem areas in notes for future reference.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How are fields linked to crops?</strong></summary>

When creating a new crop, you can select one or more fields to associate with it. The fields will show as "in use" until the crop cycle completes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I see what crops were grown on a field before?</strong></summary>

Yes, each field maintains a crop history showing all crops that have been grown on it. This helps you plan crop rotation and track field productivity over time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can one field have multiple crops at the same time?</strong></summary>

A field can only be associated with one active crop at a time. Once the crop is marked as Sold (for annual) or Removed (for perennial), the field becomes available for new crops.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between field expenses and crop expenses?</strong></summary>

Field expenses are costs related to the field itself (land preparation, fencing, permanent irrigation) that aren't specific to any crop. Crop expenses are directly related to growing a particular crop (seeds, fertilizers for that crop).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does crop history help with rotation?</strong></summary>

The crop history shows you what was planted on each field and when. This data helps you avoid planting the same crop family consecutively, maintain soil health, and break pest cycles.
