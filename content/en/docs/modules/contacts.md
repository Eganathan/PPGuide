## How It Works

### Inventory Purchases
When adding stock to inventory, select the vendor using "Bought From". This creates a transaction record linked to that contact.

**Example:** If you buy ₹5,000 worth of fertilizer from "ABC Suppliers", this appears in ABC Suppliers' contact detail as a purchase transaction.

The contact detail shows total purchases by inventory category (e.g., "Fertilizer: ₹50,000 total").

### Income Sales
When recording income from crops or livestock sales, select the buyer contact. This creates a transaction record linked to that contact.

**Example:** If you sell ₹20,000 worth of rice to "XYZ Traders", this appears in XYZ Traders' contact detail as a sale transaction.

### Contact Detail Screen
The contact detail screen shows a complete transaction history with that contact, combining both purchases and sales.

**Features:**
- Total amount purchased from the contact
- Breakdown by inventory category
- Total amount sold to the contact
- Individual transaction history with dates
