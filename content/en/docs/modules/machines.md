# Machines Module

Track your farm machinery including tractors and implements. Monitor usage patterns, maintenance schedules, and generate reports for service and usage history.

## Key Features

### Tractors & Implements
Machines are categorized into Tractors (powered equipment with engines) and Implements (attachments that connect to tractors).

### Usage Tracking
View usage histories for tractors. Track when and where each machine was used across your farm operations.

### Expense Mapping
Link tractors and implements to expenses on Farms, Fields, Crops, or Livestock. This helps analyze usage patterns and costs.

### Reports
Download usage reports and service reports from the machine list screen to track maintenance and operational data.

## Machine Types

### Tractors
Any powered equipment with an engine. This includes tractors, harvesters, tillers, pump sets, and other motorized machinery.

**Examples:** Tractors, Power tillers, Harvesters, Pump sets, Sprayers with motors

**Supported Actions:** Expenses, Tasks, Notes, Documents

**Features:**
- Track expenses like fuel, repairs, and servicing
- Schedule maintenance tasks and reminders
- Record notes about performance or issues
- Store documents like purchase receipts and manuals
- View complete usage history

### Implements
Attachments and tools that connect to tractors. These are non-powered accessories used for specific farming operations.

**Examples:** Ploughs, Cultivators, Seed drills, Trailers, Rotavators, Harrows

> **Note:** Implements do not have their own actions. They are tracked for inventory and can be linked to tractor expenses when used together.

## Usage Mapping

When recording expenses for Farms, Fields, Crops, or Livestock, you can specify which tractor and implement was used. This creates a usage record.

### Benefits
- See which machines are used most frequently
- Track machine usage across different modules
- Calculate operating costs per crop or field
- Identify maintenance needs based on usage
- Generate comprehensive usage reports

### How It Works
When creating an expense on a Farm, Field, Crop, or Livestock, select the tractor and/or implement used. This links the expense to the machine's usage history.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between tractors and implements?</strong></summary>

Tractors are powered machines with engines (tractors, harvesters, pump sets). Implements are non-powered attachments that connect to tractors (ploughs, cultivators, seed drills). Only tractors support actions like expenses and tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't I add expenses to implements?</strong></summary>

Implements are tracked for inventory purposes and usage mapping only. Since they don't consume fuel or require regular servicing like tractors, they don't have separate actions. Implement-related costs can be recorded under the tractor they're attached to.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I track which machines were used for a crop?</strong></summary>

When recording an expense on a crop, you can select the tractor and implement used. This creates a usage record that appears in the machine's usage history and can be included in reports.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I generate usage or service reports?</strong></summary>

Go to the machine list screen where you can download usage reports and service reports. These show usage patterns across all your operations and maintenance history.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I track rental income from machines?</strong></summary>

Currently, machines support expenses, tasks, notes, and documents. For rental income tracking, you would record this separately.
