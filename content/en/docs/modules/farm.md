# Farm Module

Create and manage your farm profile. The Farm module is the foundation of Pannai, where you set up your farm details and manage overall farm-level activities.

## Key Features

### Farm Profile
Set up your farm with essential details like name, location, and total area. This becomes your central hub for all farming activities.

### Multi-Farm Support
Manage multiple farms from a single account. Switch between farms to track activities for each property separately.

### Farm-Level Records
Store expenses, tasks, notes, and documents that apply to the entire farm rather than specific crops or fields.

### Team Management
Invite team members and assign roles (Owner, Manager, Worker) to collaborate on farm management.

## Tips

- Create separate farms if you manage multiple properties to keep records organized.
- Use farm-level expenses for costs that benefit the entire operation, not specific modules.
- Store important documents like land records and insurance policies in the Farm module for easy access.
- Add team members through the farm settings to enable collaboration.
- Use farm-level notes to record annual plans, seasonal strategies, or meeting summaries.
