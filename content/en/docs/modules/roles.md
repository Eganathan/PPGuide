# Roles Module

Manage your farm team with different access levels. Assign roles to control what each team member can see and do in the app.

## Key Features

### Role-Based Access
Three user roles with different permission levels: Owner, Manager, and Worker.

### Team Collaboration
Add team members to your farm and assign appropriate roles based on their responsibilities.

### Data Privacy
Sensitive financial data like income is protected from worker access while allowing them to do their tasks.

### Data Continuity
When a user deletes their account, their data is transferred to the owner to maintain complete farm records.

## Inviting Team Members

### How to Invite
1. Go to **Farmers** section
2. Tap on **Invites**
3. Tap **Create Invite**
4. Send the invite to the person

### For New Users
Once they download the app and create an account, they will automatically see the invite. They can accept it to join your farm.

### For Users Who Already Have a Farm
If the person has already onboarded as an owner of their own farm, they need to:

1. Delete their existing farm
2. Re-load/restart the app
3. The invite will now be visible
4. Accept the invite to join your farm

> **Important:** A user can only be part of one farm at a time. They must remove their existing farm before accepting an invite to another farm.

## Account Deletion & Data Transfer

When any user deletes their account, all their data is automatically transferred to the farm owner.

### Process
1. User initiates account deletion
2. All data created by that user is migrated to the owner's account
3. Transferred data is marked/indicated as "transferred data"
4. Farm records remain complete and intact

### Benefits
- No data loss when team members leave
- Complete historical records maintained
- Continuity of farm documentation
- Transferred data clearly identified

## Tips

- Assign the Manager role to trusted family members or senior staff who need full farm visibility.
- Use the Worker role for laborers and temporary staff who only need to see their assigned tasks.
- Workers can record their own expenses and activities without seeing sensitive financial data.
- Review user roles periodically and upgrade workers to managers as they take on more responsibility.
- Only share Owner access with someone you fully trust, as they would have farm deletion rights.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between Owner and Manager?</strong></summary>

Owner and Manager have almost identical access to all farm data including income, expenses, analytics, and reports. The key differences are: only the Owner can delete the farm, and only the Owner can change other users' roles to/from Owner level.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What can Workers see?</strong></summary>

Workers have a simplified view showing only: tasks assigned to them, expenses they created, documents they added, and notes they recorded. They cannot see income details, analytics, reports, or any data created by other users.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't Workers see income?</strong></summary>

Income data contains sensitive financial information about the farm's earnings. This is restricted to Owner and Manager roles to maintain financial privacy while allowing workers to perform their daily tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can a Manager upgrade a Worker?</strong></summary>

Yes, Managers can upgrade Workers to Manager role. However, Managers cannot change the Owner's role or downgrade other Managers - only the Owner has those permissions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens when someone deletes their account?</strong></summary>

All data created by that user (expenses, tasks, notes, etc.) is automatically transferred to the farm Owner's account. This data is marked as "transferred data" so you know its origin, ensuring no farm records are lost.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I have multiple Owners?</strong></summary>

Each farm has one Owner. If you need to give someone full access, make them a Manager - they'll have access to all data and most management functions except farm deletion and owner-level role changes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I invite someone to my farm?</strong></summary>

Go to Farmers → Invites → Create Invite, then send the invite to the person. When they create an account or open the app, they'll see your invite and can accept it to join your farm.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The person I invited can't see the invite. What should they do?</strong></summary>

If they already have their own farm as an owner, they need to delete their farm first, then restart the app. The invite will then appear. A user can only be part of one farm at a time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can someone be part of multiple farms?</strong></summary>

No, a user can only be part of one farm at a time. To join a different farm, they must first leave or delete their current farm.
