# Crops Module

Track your crops from planting to harvest and beyond. Manage crop stages, monitor growth progress, and record all related activities throughout each season.

## Key Features

### Crop Types
Specify the crop type to automatically classify as annual or perennial. This determines how the crop lifecycle and field associations are managed.

### Stage Tracking
Track your crop through 7 stages: Preparation, Seeding, Growing, Fruiting, Harvesting, Post-Harvest, and Sold.

### Season Management
Create seasons to organize activities by crop cycle. For perennial crops, new seasons are prompted automatically when the crop is marked as sold.

### Field Association
Link crops to specific fields to track which areas are in use. Fields are automatically released based on crop type and stage.

## Crop Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Preparation** | Initial stage for preparing the field and planning the crop cycle |
| **Seeding** | Seeds or seedlings have been planted in the field |
| **Growing** | Crop is actively growing and developing |
| **Fruiting** | Crop has begun producing fruits, grains, or harvestable produce |
| **Harvesting** | Crop is ready for or currently being harvested |
| **Post-Harvest** | Harvest complete. Processing, drying, or storage activities |
| **Sold** | Crop has been sold. Field release behavior depends on crop type |

## Annual vs Perennial Crops

### Annual Crops
Annual crops complete their lifecycle in one season. When marked as **Sold**, associated fields are automatically released for new crops.

### Perennial Crops
Perennial crops continue across multiple seasons. When marked as **Sold**, the crop automatically moves to Preparation stage for a new season. Fields remain associated until the crop is moved to **Removed** stage.

> **Tip:** To release fields from a perennial crop, update the crop status to "Removed".
