# Actions

Actions are activities you perform on your modules (Crops, Fields, Livestock, etc.). Each action helps you track different aspects of your farming operations.

## Available Actions

| Action | Description | Available In |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Income](/en/docs/actions/income/) | Record all revenue and sales | Crops, Livestock |
| [Expenses](/en/docs/actions/expenses/) | Track all costs and expenditures | Farm, Crops, Fields, Livestock, Machines, Inventory |
| [Tasks](/en/docs/actions/tasks/) | Schedule and manage activities | Farm, Crops, Fields, Livestock, Machines, Inventory |
| [Notes](/en/docs/actions/notes/) | Record observations and comments | Farm, Crops, Fields, Livestock, Machines, Inventory |
| [Yields](/en/docs/actions/yields/) | Track harvest and production output | Crops, Livestock |
| [Documents](/en/docs/actions/documents/) | Attach files, photos, and receipts | Farm, Crops, Fields, Livestock, Machines, Inventory |
| [Animals](/en/docs/actions/animals/) | Manage individual animal profiles | Dairy Cattle only |

## How Actions Work

Actions are contextual - they appear based on the module you're working with. For example:
- **Farm** has Expenses, Tasks, Notes, and Documents
- **Crops** have Income, Expenses, Tasks, Notes, Yields, and Documents
- **Fields** have Expenses, Tasks, Notes, and Documents
- **Livestock** have Income, Expenses, Tasks, Notes, Yields, Documents, and Animals (for dairy cattle)
- **Machines** have Expenses, Tasks, Notes, and Documents
- **Inventory** has Expenses, Tasks, Notes, and Documents

Each action creates a record linked to that specific module entry, making it easy to see all related activities in one place.
