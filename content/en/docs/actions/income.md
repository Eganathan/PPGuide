## Inventory Integration

When recording income, you can link inventory items (Yield category) to track exactly what was sold and automatically update stock levels.

### Complete Sales Workflow

1. **Record Yield** - Track your harvest or production
2. **Add to Inventory** - Create a Yield inventory item, add saleable quantity
3. **Record Income** - Link the inventory item when recording the sale
4. **Stock Updated** - Inventory quantity automatically reduces

> **Why this workflow?** Not all yield goes to inventory (some is spoilt/damaged), and not all inventory is sold at once. This gives you accurate tracking of production, stock, and sales.

## Contact Integration

Select a buyer contact when recording income to build a transaction history. Sales linked to contacts appear in the contact detail screen, helping you:
- Track your biggest buyers
- View total sales to each contact
- Build customer relationships

---

## Tips

- Record sales immediately to maintain accurate income records
- Always select the buyer contact to build transaction history
- Link inventory items to automatically update stock levels
- Track partial sales separately to monitor selling patterns
- Include buyer details for future reference and repeat sales

---

## Best Practices

- Record income on the same day as the sale
- Include quantity and rate for accurate per-unit calculations
- Link to buyer contact for relationship tracking
- Link to inventory for stock management
- Add notes for special arrangements or payment terms
