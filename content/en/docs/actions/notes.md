# Notes Action

Record observations, comments, and important information about your farming activities.

## Purpose

Document anything noteworthy about your crops, animals, equipment, or fields. Notes serve as your farm diary, capturing observations, experiments, and lessons learned that help improve future decisions.

## Key Features

- **Free-form text** - Write anything without structured fields
- **Date-stamped** - Each note is automatically dated
- **Module linked** - Notes are tied to specific crops, livestock, fields, etc.
- **Searchable** - Find past notes by searching keywords
- **Historical record** - Build a knowledge base over time

## What to Record

### Crop Notes
- Pest or disease sightings with location and severity
- Weather impact (heavy rain, frost, heatwave effects)
- Growth observations (early flowering, stunted growth)
- Experiment results (new fertilizer, different spacing)
- Harvest quality observations

### Livestock Notes
- Behavioral changes (reduced appetite, lethargy)
- Health symptoms before calling the vet
- Breeding observations (heat signs, mating dates)
- Birth details (ease of delivery, offspring health)
- Milk quality changes

### Field Notes
- Soil conditions (waterlogging, erosion, compaction)
- Drainage problems and solutions
- Weed pressure areas
- Pest hotspots for future reference
- Successful crop combinations

### Machine Notes
- Unusual sounds or vibrations
- Performance issues
- Repair details and parts used
- Fuel consumption changes
- Operator feedback

## Tips

- Record weather observations that affect your farming
- Document pest or disease sightings immediately with details
- Note successful techniques for future reference
- Include specific details: quantities, locations, severity
- Write notes the same day - details fade quickly

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** - "Aphids on lower leaves of row 3" is better than "pest problem"
- **Record immediately** - Note observations the same day they occur
- **Use consistent terms** - Makes searching easier later
- **Include context** - Weather, recent activities, or anything relevant
- **Review periodically** - Past notes often contain valuable lessons

## Note Ideas by Season

### Pre-Season
- Soil preparation observations
- Seed quality notes
- Equipment readiness checks
- Weather forecasts and plans

### Growing Season
- Weekly growth observations
- Pest and disease monitoring
- Irrigation effectiveness
- Fertilizer response

### Harvest Season
- Yield quality observations
- Timing notes (too early, just right, too late)
- Labor and equipment performance
- Market feedback on produce

### Off-Season
- Lessons learned summary
- Plans for next season
- Equipment storage notes
- Soil improvement observations

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How is Notes different from Tasks?</strong></summary>

Notes record observations and information (what happened, what you saw). Tasks schedule future activities (what needs to be done). Use Notes to document, use Tasks to plan.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add photos to notes?</strong></summary>

For photos, use the Documents action which is designed for file attachments. Notes are text-based. You can create a note and a document together to combine text observations with photos.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I find old notes?</strong></summary>

Navigate to the module (crop, livestock, etc.) and open the Notes section. You can scroll through the history or search for keywords.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I create separate notes or one long note?</strong></summary>

Create separate notes for different topics or dates. This makes it easier to find specific information later. Each note is date-stamped, so multiple notes per day is fine.
