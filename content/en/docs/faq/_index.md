## General Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Personal Pannai?</strong></summary>

Personal Pannai is a comprehensive farm management app that helps you track crops, livestock, machinery, inventory, and finances. "Pannai" means "farm" in Tamil.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What modules are available?</strong></summary>

Personal Pannai includes modules for:
- **Crops** - Track planting to harvest
- **Fields** - Manage land and crop rotation
- **Livestock** - Track cattle, poultry, goats, sheep, pigs
- **Machines** - Monitor tractors and implements
- **Inventory** - Manage seeds, fertilizers, fuel
- **Contacts** - Track vendors and buyers
- **Roles** - Manage team access
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can multiple people use the same farm?</strong></summary>

Yes! You can invite team members to your farm with different roles:
- **Owner** - Full access and control
- **Manager** - Full data access, limited management
- **Worker** - Only sees their own tasks and activities
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I track profitability?</strong></summary>

Record all income and expenses for your crops or livestock. The app calculates profit by comparing total income against total expenses. Make sure to record ALL costs for accurate calculations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I track individual animals?</strong></summary>

Yes, but only for dairy cattle. Enable "Track Individually" when creating a dairy cattle livestock entry. This allows you to create profiles for each cow/buffalo and track their milk production separately.
</details>

## Data & Privacy

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens to my data if a team member leaves?</strong></summary>

When any user deletes their account, all their data is automatically transferred to the farm owner. The transferred data is marked so you know its origin. This ensures no farm records are lost.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I back up my data?</strong></summary>

Your data is synced to the cloud. Make sure you're signed in and have a stable internet connection to ensure your data is backed up.
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't I see certain features?</strong></summary>

Some features are role-dependent:
- **Workers** cannot see income, analytics, or other users' data
- **Individual animal tracking** only appears for dairy cattle with "Track Individually" enabled
- **Some actions** only appear for certain module types
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Someone I invited can't see the invite</strong></summary>

If they already own their own farm, they need to delete their farm first, then restart the app. A user can only be part of one farm at a time.
</details>
